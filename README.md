## ☁️ Deployment on AWS EC2

### Requirements

* AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended)
* Docker & Docker Compose
* Open ports in Security Group:

  * 22 (SSH)
  * 5000 (Backend)
  * 5173 (Frontend)
  * 80 / 443 (optional, production)

### Deployment Steps

```bash
ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker

git clone https://github.com/your-username/lab-reservation-system.git
cd lab-reservation-system

docker compose up --build -d
```

## 🔐 Security Highlights

* Firebase ID Token → Backend JWT normalization
* Role-based authorization
* Private image storage (no public buckets)
* Signed URLs for controlled image access
* Stripe metadata validation (userId, reservaId)
* Environment isolation with Docker

## 📌 Best Practices Applied

* Containerized full-stack architecture
* Secure payment flow with webhooks
* External managed services (Firebase, Stripe)
* Separation of concerns (Frontend / Backend)
* Cloud-ready deployment (AWS EC2)

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Nginx reverse proxy + HTTPS (Let's Encrypt)
* CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
* Real-time updates (WebSockets / SSE)
* Monitoring & logging
